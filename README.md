# Craigslist-Webpage

This project was our final project in the User Interfaces subject. It consists of an entire redesign of <a href="https://madrid.craigslist.es">Craigslist</a>, an advertisement webpage. The redesign covers the 3 main pages where the action takes place: Home page, Subcategory page and Advertisement page.

## What is in the recository?
The repository contains every file of the redesing:
* The HTML and CSS of each page.
* The Javascript file which makes all transicions works.
* The images used.

## Description:

### Home:
In this page we have a list of all the categories existing in the website, presented in such a way that is easier for the user to identify and search through them, with a desplegable menu for each of the categories that show up the subcategories of it. We also have a left menu in which the same information is presented, but in a different format so the user has another way of accessing to the same part of the website.

When clicking one of the categories, a menu pops up with all the subcategories of that menu. This way the user can search through the page easily.

### Subcategory:
In this page we show all the different advertisements of a given subcategory inside the website. We do this in such a way to show the user all the useful information he has available inside those ads, such as the name, the date and a small image representing the product and/or service.

We also have, as we said before, a button that sorts the ads of the page, either by name or date in which it was published, so the user can traverse through the information with ease.

### Advertisement:
In this case, we present one of the advertisements of our page in a simple format, with the title, the description of the ad and a slider of images that the person of interest can upload to show and promote his product. Below that we have a selection of buttons that helps us contact the advertiser, report the ad, share it or add it to favorites.
